# DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHMS(C++)

## DISCLAMER(Very Very Important)
   1. Knowing a programming language and DSA are two different things . 
   
      eg. you might be knowing python , c, c++ , java etc but if you know DSA then you can implement them in any programming language with minor syntatic modifications .
      
   2. This Repository does not intend to spoon feed , it can be used for studying in the right direction , but the efforts should be solely yours .
   
## WHY ?
  If you want to crack the interviews and get into the product based compnies.
  
  If you love to solve the real-world complex problems.
  
## WHY C++ ?
  C++ is by far the the most popular language of choice for competitive programmers across the world as it is usually faster than Java and Python, and most of the resources are available in C++. C++ also has a vast library called STL(Standard Template Library) which makes life a lot easier for competitive coders.
